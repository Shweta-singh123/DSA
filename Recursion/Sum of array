Given an array of length N, you need to find and return the sum of all elements of the array.

CODE:
public class Solution {

	public static int sum(int input[]) {
		return helper(input,0);
	}
		/* Your class should be named Solution
		 * Don't write main().
		 * Don't read input, it is passed as function argument.
		 * Return output and don't print it.
	 	 * Taking input and printing output is handled automatically.
		*/
		public static int helper(int[] input,int index){
			if(index == input.length){
				return 0;
		}
		return input[index]+ helper(input,index+1);
	}
}
