A celebrity is a person who is known to all but does not know anyone at a party. If you go to a party of N people, find if there is a celebrity in the party or not.
A square NxN matrix M[][] is used to represent people at the party such that if an element of row i and column j  is set to 1 it means ith person knows jth person. Here M[i][i] will always be 0.
Note: Follow 0 based indexing.

Time complexity: O(N^2)
Space Complexity: O(N)

class Solution
{ 
    //Function to find if there is a celebrity in the party or not.
    int celebrity(int M[][], int n)
    {
    	int[] in= new int[n];
    	int[] out= new int[n];
    	
    	for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
    	    for(int j=0;j<n;j++){
    	        if(M[i][j]==1){
    	            out[i]++;
    	            in[j]++;
    	        }
    	    }
    	}
    	
    	for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
    	    if(in[i]==n-1 && out[i]==0){
    	        return i;
    	    }
    	}
    	return -1;
    }
}
